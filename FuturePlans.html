            I Have always loved playing videogames 
            and enjoy other people playing games that I love and even 
            games that I am completly unfimiliar with. I don't completly 
            remember when I decided this but I want to create games that 
            I and others enjoy. I think one of the rasons I came to this 
            conclusion is that even though I play videogames plenty I am 
            simply not good at them.
        </div>

    <p style="font-size: 3vw;"> 
        I plan on joining a game developing company and also doing some 
        indie stuff as well. I want to get the expeirence from working 
        in a company to hopefully learn some tecniques to further my 
        ability to make the games that I want to make, not only that,
        but I want to meet more people like me in the workplace and 
        gain connections.</p>
